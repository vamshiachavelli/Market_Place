**Challenges Faced**
 It took some time for us to comprehend how PHP, Laravel, and React worked together since I had no prior expertise with any of them.
 We first had trouble allocating tasks to each team member because we were all working remotely.
 The current chat feature is implemented as a public chat. We could have done it as private one-one chat.
 Data loading animation spinner could have been added.
 Due to difficulty in implementing web socket io we were unable to add private chat.
